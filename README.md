# Vulnerable-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze how the word "vulnerable" is used in different contexts to gain understanding about it's meaning and how its connotation differs across subjects.

This repo contains three scripts: one that web scrapes all the General Conference talks given by the current (to-date) First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; one that web scrapes vulnerability articles found on https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=vulnerabilities; and one that searches Religious, Security, and Business texts for forms of the word "vulnerable" and analyzes word frequencies and sentiment. The output of the last script is three csv files--one with aggregate information about the text genre and overall findings, one with the sentences that contain the word "vulnerable", and one with the word frequencies and sentiment found in the "vulnerable" sentences.
