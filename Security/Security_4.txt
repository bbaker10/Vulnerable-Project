Another Spectre-Like CPU Vulnerability.

Google and Microsoft researchers have disclosed another Spectre-like CPU side-channel vulnerability, called "Speculative Store Bypass." Like the others, the fix will slow the CPU down.
The German tech site Heise reports that more are coming.
I'm not surprised. Writing about Spectre and Meltdown in January, I predicted that we'll be seeing a lot more of these sorts of vulnerabilities.
Spectre and Meltdown are pretty catastrophic vulnerabilities, but they only affect the confidentiality of data. Now that they -- and the research into the Intel ME vulnerability -- have shown researchers where to look, more is coming -- and what they'll find will be worse than either Spectre or Meltdown.
I still predict that we'll be seeing lots more of these in the coming months and years, as we learn more about this class of vulnerabilities.
