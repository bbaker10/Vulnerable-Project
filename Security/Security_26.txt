Priority Cell Phones for First Responders.

Verizon has announced that is has activated the Access Overload Control (ACCOLC) system, allowing some cell phones to have priority access to the network, even when the network is overloaded.
If you are a first responder with a Verizon phone, please visit the government's WPS Requestor to provide the necessary information to have your handset activated.
Sounds like you're going to have to enter some sort of code into your handset.  I wonder how long before someone hacks that system.
