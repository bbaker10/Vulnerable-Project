Unicode URL Hack.

A long time ago I wrote about the security risks of Unicode.  This is an example of the problem.
Here's a demo: it's a Web page that appears to be www.paypal.com but is not PayPal. Everything from the address bar to the hover-over status on the link says www.paypal.com.
It works by substituting a Unicode character for the second "a" in PayPal. That Unicode character happens to look like an English "a," but it's not an "a."  The attack works even under SSL.
Here's the source code of the link:  http://www.p&#1072;ypal.com/
Secuna has some information on how to fix this vulnerability.  So does BoingBoing.
